# Pokemon-Stream-Tool

In heavy WIP

This branch contains modifications from the original code in order to use Pok√©mon Showdown's API, as conveniently modularized by [`@pkmn`](https://github.com/pkmn/ps).

Since we have introduced runtime dependencies, we might as well disregard the original Stream Tool's goals and bundle everything (except assets) into a single AppImage.

Even if we don't end up doing that, having the package.json in the parent directory should help a lot with IDE workflow.
